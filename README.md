# Sorted-List-via-cpp

IMPORTANT! : Programming assignment is given as as ............pdf .

This project contains the implementation of a SortedList class and accompanying test cases to verify its functionality. The code  demonstrates the use of dynamic arrays, exception handling, and various list operations.

Features of the SortedList Class
1. Dynamic Sorted Storage : Maintains a list of floating-point numbers in sorted order automatically.

2. Core Functionalities:

Insertion: Adds elements while preserving the sorted order.
Deletion: Removes elements at a specified index.
Copying: Deep copy of one sorted list into another.
Index Access: Retrieves elements by their index with bounds checking.
Find: Searches for an element and returns its index using binary search.
Print: Outputs all elements in the list to the console.
Exception Handling : Throws exceptions for invalid operations (e.g., out-of-range index, exceeding maximum capacity).
Macro Definition : Uses SORTEDLIST_MAX_SIZE to define the maximum number of elements (set to 20).
